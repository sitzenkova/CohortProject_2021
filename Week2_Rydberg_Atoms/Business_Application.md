# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Given a set of objects for instance antennas, satellites, etc, which objects should you choose such that you maximize objects coverage without any overlaps?
This problem is an example of an optimization problem known as the maximum independent set problem. The objective is to maximize the number of nodes in a set, so that no edges are contained in the set. The maximum independent set problem besides proving the computational complexity of many theoretical problems, serves also as a useful model for real world optimization problems in numerous fields, including information retrieval, signal transmission analysis, classification theory, economics, scheduling, big data, error correcting codes, wireless networks and biomedical engineering [Butenko, S. 2003](http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/E0/00/10/11/00001/butenko_s.pdf).

In many cases, a massive data set can be represented as a very large graph with certain attributes associated with its vertices and edges. These attributes may contain specific information characterizing the given application. Studying the structure of this graph is important for understanding the structural properties of the application it represents, as well as for improving storage organization and information retrieval.

1.6. Error Correcting Memory
ECC Memory market valuation to Reach USD 13.08 Billion by 2025 at a 6.6% CAGR [ECC Memory Market](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/15/2247668/0/en/ECC-Memory-Market-Valuation-to-Reach-USD-13-08-Billion-by-2025-at-a-6-6-CAGR-Asserts-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html).
Error correcting codes lie in the heart of digital technology, making cell phones and modems possible. They are also of a special significance due to increasing importance of reliability issues in internet transmissions. We deal with binary codes of given length correcting certain types of errors. For such codes, a graph can be constructed, in which each vertex corresponds to a binary vector and the edges are built in the way, that each independent set corresponds to a correcting code. The problem of finding the largest code is thus reduced to the maximum independent set problem in the corresponding graph. Exact solutions and estimates for the size of largest error-correcting codes of larger length can be computed by designing and applying even more efficient, possibly parallel, algorithms for solving maximum independent set problem to optimality.

The proposal we make to the telecom and IoT market clients (combined market value of $US2 trillion as of 2020), adopted from [Farooq, M. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article/63/6/958/5808800) is as follows: 

The growing need for IoT devices and the spread of 5G technology infrastructure may put challenges in routing protocol design. Internet of Things (IoT) is an example of low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The routing protocol for LLNs is a standard routing framework for IoT. Typically, devices forming an LLN possess limited energy, scarce resources, mostly harsh operating environment and in such a network radio transmission coverage is limited. Therefore, if an LLN is required to cover a relatively large geographical area, multi-hop communication is required. This results in a requirement that devices in a network should rely each other data packets. Hence, a routing protocol to discover and maintain multipoint-to-point (MP-to-P), point-to-point (P-to-P) and point-to-multipoint (P-to-MP) data forwarding paths is needed. 
It is known that routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL)'s control overhead can result in the protocol’s poor performance in P-to-P and P-to-MP communications especially in its non-storing mode of operation. Moreover, LLNs have dense node deployments. Lowering the control message overhead may not help in achieving a performance objective. Hence, there is a need for a multi-gateway communication architecture that partitions a network in different subnets, and each subnet is under the control of a different gateway. This also highlights the need for inter-gateway communication mechanism so that nodes in different subnets can communicate with each other. A UD-MIS can be used potentially to reduce the density of the network by appropriately placing the gateways and optimizing the control message overhead. The statement needs to be researched. 
An IoT communication architecture using industrial process control as an example use case is depicted in Fig 1.
 
Fig. 1> ![IoT communication architecture.]()

In the industrial process control, status of different devices is regularly reported to a central entity/gateway. Hence, there is a need for multipoint-to-point (MP-to-P) communication. Similarly, the central entity sends different control commands to different devices, thus there is a need for point-to-multipoint (P-to-MP) communication. Usually, in an industrial process control system, devices need to communicate with each other to successfully complete a task, hence there is a need for point-to-point (P-to-P) communication. Invariably, the central entity is connected to the Internet, and it stores important information in one of the servers reachable through the Internet or local network. Moreover, a user can interact with the central entity over the Internet to accomplish relevant tasks.
